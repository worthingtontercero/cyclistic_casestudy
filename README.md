Purpose. Cyclistic’s marketing team believes future growth depends on increasing annual memberships. This project analyzes behavioral differences between casual and member riders to inform tactics that convert casual riders into members. Deliverables: a clear business task, data source & cleaning docs, analysis summary, polished visuals, and top recommendations.

About the company/data. Cyclistic is a Chicago bike-share with ~5.8k bikes and 600–700 stations; most trips are leisure, ~30% are commutes. Plans include single-ride, day pass, and annual membership; finance has shown members are more profitable than casuals. For this capstone, “Cyclistic” is fictional but uses real Divvy trip data (public, no PII). In RStudio, the brief recommends Divvy 2019 Q1 and Divvy 2020 Q1 for memory reasons; those are the datasets used here.

Analyst goal. Answer: “How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?” Then translate insights into evidence-backed marketing recommendations (e.g., when/where to target, which offers, and operational tweaks like station sizing and rebalancing).
